# Animal-Type-prediction-
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of building a classifier to predict animal types using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Working with the Zoo.csv dataset, which includes 101 animals described by 16 physical attributes, the primary goal was to accurately assign each animal to one of seven distinct classes. The project began with a thorough data exploration using visualizations to understand feature distributions, followed by preprocessing steps where the data was checked for missing values, scaled using MinMaxScaler for optimal performance, and split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets. A key part of the methodology was systematically finding the best hyperparameter for K by implementing the elbow method, which identified K=3 as the most effective number of neighbors. The final model was then built and evaluated on the unseen test data, achieving a high accuracy of 95%. In addition to this strong quantitative result, the project also includes a visualization of the model's decision boundaries, which was accomplished by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature dimensions and plot how the algorithm separates the different animal classes.
